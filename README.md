## Executive Summary 

#### - Business Problem
Pace Telecom is facing challenges in establishing a significant Market Share in the East Coast region, despite successfully acquiring new customers.

#### - Proposed Solution
Accelerating customer acquisition without maintaining market share may lead to underperformance in the East Coast region. Given the current scenario, customer retention would possibly be the optimal solution.


## Data

- Source: Marketing Team
- Size: 7032 customers * 20 characteristics
- Time Period: 1st January,2023 - 1st October, 2023

#### Data Exclusion
- Considering the ethnicity concern, sensitive details such as name, address, banking details and joining date are excluded by the HR team.
- Information this sensitive can lead to biases by any data operator. 
- Information like address and name must be preserved because incase of a data breach, customers can get on the verge of identity theft.

#### Data Assumption
The dataset was provided by our marketing team which was extracted directly from the service dealers, so it is assumed that the dataset contains all the customers as its mandatory to register a customer before providing the service and the details in the dataset are correct.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Exploring Churn pattern with types of Contract.

Key Takeaways
- Majority of customers choose Monthly contracts. 
- Probably because they were new to the company and unsure about the service so chose monthly plan and kept using the same

#### Exploring Churn pattern with types of Contract. -2

Key Takeaways
- Maximum churn happens in customers who choose monthly contract at 42.7%.
- Churn rate for customers with yearly contract is significantly lower at 11.28% and 2.85%.

Graph Notes
- Blue plots | No Churn

#### Exploring Churn pattern with Tenure.

Key notes

- Chances of customer turning down the service during the first year of operation are highest at 47.68%
- The longer the customer keeps using the service, the lesser are their chances of churning.

## Modeling

#### Outcome variable
- Using this model, we are trying to predict what amount of our customers may churn by the end of this year.
- Predicting the future churn can be used in targeting retention to customers likely to churn. 
- Retaining customers and acquiring new ones can help business achieve the solution proposed by marketing and data team.


#### Features
While predicting customer churn, we found following variables to be highly important,
- Contract : The duration of contract. (monthly, 1 year or 2 year)
- Tenure: Fow how long the customer has been using the service.
- Online Security: has customer opted for online security or not.
-  Monthly Charges: the monthly billed amount.

Refer this File for full list of features.


#### Random Forest
Random Forest will be a perfect fit for our problem as
- The dataset is showcasing complex relationships among multiple features.
- It provides feature importance which can be used to understand the factors driving customer to churn.
- The ensemble effect will result in more stable and reliable model.


#### Training, testing and predicting data
- The data acquired from 1st january, 2023 â€“ 1st october, 2023 will be used to train the model.
- A 20% randomly selected section of that data will be used to evaluate the model, to check whether the model is performing upto mark or not.
- Using the trained model, we will predict churn among customers who joined out service from october 1st to november 10th, 2023.

## Findings

#### Model Evaluation
{image link}
{image link}
- False Negative can hide potential churns as not churns and can hurt our retention goals, So we need to make sure that our model is producing least FN.

- Recall = ability of a model to correctly identify all True Positive = TP/ TP+FN = 85.71%
---

#### Model Findings - Total potential Churn
{image link}
- Model Suggests that out of all the new customers we acquired from october 1st to november 10th, 34% of them might churn.

- The churning of this customers can hurt our Market capture goals of 2023-Q4.

#### Model Findings - Contract Type in Churn
{image link}
- Among those 34% potential churning customers, 78% of them have opted for monthly contracts.
## Recommendations

Based on the done analysis, the following steps can be recommended:
    
    - Offer yearly contract to customers who opt monthly contract consecutively.
    
    - Prioritize support and retain customers with tenure < 1 year without compromising support for other customers.


#### Offering yearly contract.

- Statistics show that customers with yearly contract has 11.28% (for 1 year) and 2.85% (for 2 year) chances of churning where 43% for monthly user. 
- This may be because during the short commitment, the customer might be looking for a better offer from other providers and if found, then leveraging their small commitment, they might switch to other provider.
- Monthly contract also don't provide as greater value as yearly contract does, so offering them yearly contract can bring down their monthly bills, convincing them to not churn by the next contract.
- By offering yearly contracts to customer, their churn rate may decrease, resulting in retaining more customers thus solving our business problem in hand.

#### Prioritize customers with tenure < 1 year

- About 48% of customers churns by their first year of service, but only 29% within second year and keeps decreasing there on.
- This can be because of the trust customers build by working with us, the more they stay, the more their trust, resulting in lower chances of churning.
- Prioritizing support for customers with tenure < 1 year may retain group of customers who are most possible to churn. 
- Doing so may have good long time impact on company as more customers will build trust towards us and can be retained for longer tenures thus solving our business problem in hand.
